Collateral and Cash Payment
Capitalised terms used in this Collateral and Cash Payment Procedures and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meaning given pursuant to the remainder of the CDS Clearing Documentation,
as such term is defined in the document entitled "CDS Clearing Rule Book" published by LCH SA, as
amended from time to time and including, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of FCM Clearing
Members, the FCM CDS Clearing Regulations.
For the purpose of this Section 3, any failure, unavailability, impairment, defect, interruption, delay
or improper functioning of any technical system, access, connection, solution, specification,
equipment, communication network or other resource used by LCH SA and/or a Clearing Member, as
applicable, to calculate, instruct, process, communicate and more generally perform its obligation
under this Section 3, shall be deemed to constitute an “exceptional circumstance” which shall not
give rise to a LCH Default and shall be promptly notified by LCH SA to the relevant Clearing Member.
3.1
TYPES OF COLLATERAL
A Clearing Member’s obligation to provide Collateral should be fulfilled in accordance with
the following table and the remainder of this Section 3 of the Procedures.
Purpose of transfer
Collateral type
Payment of Margins (other than Variation
Margin) Cash Collateral and/or Eligible Collateral
Maintenance of House Excess Collateral and
Client Excess Collateral Cash Collateral and/or Eligible Collateral
Maintenance of Client Collateral Buffer Euro denominated Cash Collateral
Payment of Contribution and Additional
Contribution Amount Euro denominated Cash Collateral
It should be noted that, notwithstanding the above table any Margin Shortfall must be
covered by an automatic debit of Euro denominated Cash Collateral.
3.2
MARGIN BALANCE AND CLIENT COLLATERAL BUFFER
The price of Eligible Currencies (other than Euro) and Eligible Collateral (the “Applicable
Price”), which is taken into account for the purposes of calculating the Margin Balance for
each Margin Account of a Clearing Member, or in the case of a CCM Gross Omnibus
Segregated Account Structure, for all the CCM Client Margin Accounts attached to that CCM
Gross Omnibus Segregated Account Structure, and the Client Collateral Buffer, is determined
by LCH SA at 14:00 and 22:00 CET on each Business Day on the basis of the latest market
prices (as published by Reuters, Interactive Data or such other provider as is notified in a
Clearing Notice).
LCH SA will calculate: (i) the Margin Balance for each Margin Account of a Clearing Member,
or in the case of a CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account Structure, for all the CCM Client
Margin Accounts attached to that CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account Structure; and (ii)
the Client Collateral Buffer each Business Day (prior to 07:45 CET and whenever a position
corresponding to the relevant trade leg of an Eligible Intraday Transaction is pre-registered in

the Applicable Price; or
ii) in respect of the FCM Margin Balance for each FCM Client Margin Account of an FCM
Clearing Member, the Legally Segregated Value recorded in the relevant FCM Client
Financial Account on the basis of the Applicable Price, in accordance with Section 2.2
(f) of the Procedures.
LCH SA will recalculate the: (i) Margin Balance for each Margin Account of a Clearing
Member, or in the case of a CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account Structure, for all the
CCM Client Margin Accounts attached to that CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account
Structure; and (ii) Client Collateral Buffer, following each Collateral Call.
Where Pledged Eligible Collateral is recorded in a Clearing Member’s Collateral Account, LCH
SA shall use the most recent Collateral Holding Report received from Euroclear Bank, in
accordance with Paragraph 5.13(f) of Section 5 of the Procedures, to determine what
Pledged Eligible Collateral should be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the
Margin Balance in respect of a particular Account Structure in accordance with this
Paragraph 3.2.
Where Eligible Collateral consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills (the “US T-Bills”) is recorded in a
FCM Clearing Member’s FCM Client Collateral Account, LCH SA shall use the most recent
collateral holding report received from Bank of New York Mellon (“BNYM US”), in
accordance with Paragraph 5.13(f) of Section 5 of the Procedures, to determine what US T-
Bills should be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the FCM Client Margin
Balance in respect of each of its FCM Client Margin Account(s) in accordance with this
Paragraph 3.2.

Collateral and Cash Payment
EURO DENOMINATED CASH COLLATERAL
(a)
LCH SA TARGET2 Accounts
LCH SA performs its Collateral Calls by using the following three TARGET2 Accounts
opened in its name:
i) a TARGET2 Account used to make Collateral Calls in relation to the House
Margin Requirement, the House Excess Collateral Threshold and in respect
of a CCM only, the CCM Client Collateral Buffer Threshold (the “LCH House
TARGET2 Account”); and
ii) with respect to Clients of a Clearing Member:
(x) a TARGET2 Account used to make Collateral Calls in relation to the
Client Margin Requirement(s) of each CCM (the “LCH CCM Client
TARGET2 Account”); or
(y) a TARGET2 Account used to make Collateral Calls in relation to the
Client Margin Requirement(s) and FCM Client Collateral Buffer
Threshold of each FCM Clearing Member (the “LCH FCM Client
TARGET2 Account”), which for the avoidance of doubt forms part of
the LCH Cleared Swaps Client Segregated Depository Account for
purposes of the FCM CDS Clearing Regulations,
together referred to as the “LCH Client TARGET2 Accounts” and individually
as a “LCH Client TARGET2 Account”.
The LCH House TARGET2 Account and the LCH Client TARGET2 Accounts shall be
together referred to as the “LCH TARGET2 Accounts”.
(b)
Clearing Member TARGET2 Accounts
A CCM has no obligation to hold two TARGET2 Accounts (or arrange its Payment
Agent holding a TARGET2 Account (the “TARGET2 Payment Agent”) to hold two cash
account(s)) for the purposes of the Collateral Calls in respect of (i) its CCM House
Margin Requirement, CCM House Excess Collateral Threshold and CCM Client
Collateral Buffer Threshold and (ii) its Client Margin Requirement(s). It may either:
i) hold one TARGET2 Account (or one cash account of its TARGET2 Payment
Agent), in which case such TARGET2 Account will be used for the debits
and credits made out of both the LCH Client TARGET2 Account and the LCH
House TARGET2 Account; or
ii) hold two TARGET2 Accounts (or two cash accounts of its TARGET2 Payment
Agent), in which case one TARGET2 account will be used for the debits and
credits made out of the LCH Client TARGET2 Account and the other will be
used for the debits and credits made out of the LCH House TARGET2
Account.
An FCM Clearing Member has an obligation to hold two TARGET2 Accounts (or
arrange its TARGET2 Payment Agent to hold two cash account(s)) for the purposes of
LCH SA ©2017

Published on 11 December 2017CDS Clearing Procedures
Collateral and Cash Payment
the Collateral Calls in respect of (i) its FCM House Margin Requirement and FCM
House Excess Collateral Threshold and (ii) its Client Margin Requirement(s) and FCM
Client Collateral Buffer Threshold (which for the avoidance of doubt forms part of
the FCM Cleared Swaps Client Segregated Depository Accounts for purposes of the
FCM CDS Clearing Regulations). Therefore, an FCM Clearing Member will hold two
TARGET2 Accounts (or two cash accounts of its TARGET2 Payment Agent), in which
case one TARGET2 account will be used for the debits and credits made out of the
LCH FCM Client TARGET2 Account and the other will be used for the debits and
credits made out of the LCH House TARGET2 Account.
If a Clearing Member wishes to add a new TARGET2 Account or replace an existing
TARGET2 Account with another for the purposes of the Collateral Calls, it may do so
by providing LCH SA with the details of the relevant TARGET2 Account with at least
15 days’ prior notice.
(c)
Timing of Collateral Calls
Where a Clearing Member is required to transfer Euro denominated Cash Collateral
at a Collateral Call, LCH SA will automatically debit such Clearing Member’s relevant
TARGET2 Account(s) (or the relevant cash account(s) of its TARGET2 Payment Agent)
on the basis of its Power of Attorney and credit the relevant LCH TARGET2 Account
with the corresponding amounts.
Where a Clearing Member is due to receive Euro denominated Cash Collateral, LCH
SA will automatically credit such Clearing Member’s TARGET2 Account(s) (or the
relevant cash account(s) of its TARGET2 Payment Agent) with the relevant amounts.
The debits or credits on each Clearing Member’s TARGET2 Account(s) (or the
relevant cash account(s) of its TARGET2 Payment Agent) will occur in accordance
with the following time slots:
LCH SA ©2017
i) initial slot: 08:00-08:55 CET (used for the purposes of the Morning Call) (the
“Initial Slot”);
ii) post-initial slot: 9:30-9:45 CET (used for the purposes of making Cash
Payments and returning Euro denominated Cash Collateral to Clearing
Member(s))(the “Post-Initial Slot”);
iii) first intraday slot: 11:25-11:50 CET (used for the purposes of the First
Intraday Call) (the “First Intraday Slot”);
iv) additional specific collateral slot: 12:25-12:55 CET (used for the purposes of
Collateral substitution upon a Clearing Member’s request) (the “Additional
Specific Collateral Slot”);
v) second intraday slot: 15:25-15:55 CET (used for the purposes of the Second
Intraday Call) (the “Second Intraday Slot”); or
vi) any other slot available to LCH SA in exceptional circumstances (the
“Exceptional Slot”);

Collateral and Cash Payment
Once the Euro denominated Cash Collateral has been debited by LCH SA it will
immediately form part of the Margin Balance for the relevant Margin Account, or in
the case of a CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account Structure, for all the CCM
Client Margin Accounts attached to that CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account
Structure, and/or the Client Collateral Buffer or the Contribution Balance, as
applicable.
(d)
Netting of payments made through TARGET2
LCH will make such debits or credits as the case may be in respect of the relevant
CCM House Margin Account, CCM Client Margin Account(s), FCM House Margin
Account and FCM Client Margin Account(s) as calculated in accordance with this sub-
section 3.7(d). If any CCM or FCM Clearing Member does not make a requisite
payment at the Initial Slot, LCH SA shall recalculate any amounts due to be paid at
the Post-Initial Slot. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt,
where the whole or part of any credit offsets a corresponding debit in any other
currency which is still outstanding at the time of the Post-Initial Slot then such debit
shall be taken into account for the calculation of the requisite amounts to be paid at
Post-Initial Slot.

it shall notify LCH SA by submitting the relevant form by any means as specified in a
Clearing Notice. The Clearing Member must specify to which Collateral Account(s)
such Euro denominated Cash Collateral should be recorded. The process that a
Clearing Member and LCH SA must follow to process the return of substituted
Collateral to the Clearing Member is set out in paragraph 3.8(h) (for non-Euro
denominated Cash Collateral), 3.8(i) (for USD denominated Cash Collateral), 3.10(c)
(for Eligible Collateral transferred with full title), 3.15(b) (for Pledged Eligible
Collateral) and 3.17(b) (for US T-Bills transferred on behalf of FCM Clients), as
applicable.
In respect of a CCM only, if such CCM notifies to LCH SA that Euro denominated Cash
Collateral will be transferred to the LCH CCM Client TARGET2 Account but the CCM
does not specify to which CCM Client Collateral Account(s) some or all of such
amounts should be recorded, LCH will proceed with the debit of the CCM’s relevant
TARGET2 Account (or the relevant cash account of its TARGET2 Payment Agent) but
will treat any amounts which have not been specifically identified as being for a
particular CCM Client Collateral Account as CCM Unallocated Client Collateral and
record such amounts in the CCM Unallocated Client Collateral Account.
A Clearing Member must notify LCH SA as set out above by no later than 10:45 CET
in order for a Clearing Member’s request to be processed and the Euro denominated
Cash Collateral called at the First Intraday Slot on the same day. A Clearing Member
must notify LCH SA as set out above between 10:45 and 17:15 CET in order for a
Clearing Member’s request to be processed and the Euro denominated Cash
Collateral called at the next TARGET2 time slot, including any Exceptional Slot. It is
the Clearing Member’s responsibility to ensure the due receipt by LCH SA of the
relevant notification. Accordingly, the Clearing Member should confirm its request
no later than 17:15 CET by a phone call to LCH SA’s collateral management team on
(+33) (0)1 70 37 66 86/66 37/65 35, although a failure to do so shall not invalidate
any request actually received by LCH SA.
On Day at the relevant TARGET2 time slot:
LCH SA will debit the Clearing Member’s relevant TARGET2 Account(s) (or the
relevant cash account(s) of its TARGET2 Payment Agent) with the amount of Euro
denominated Cash Collateral notified by the Clearing Member.
On Day at any time, a Clearing Member may transfer Euro denominated Cash
Collateral by:
i) notifying LCH SA through the relevant form by any means as specified in a
Clearing Notice. The Clearing Member must specify to which Collateral
Account(s) such Euro denominated Cash Collateral should be recorded, and
ii) crediting LCH TARGET 2 Account before 18:00 CET.
Transfer of Euro denominated Cash Collateral at any time later than the First Intraday

Return of Euro denominated Cash Collateral
i)
In respect of a Clearing Member’s House Collateral Account
1- A Clearing Member may request LCH SA to automatically credit Euro
denominated Cash Collateral recorded in its House Collateral Account to the
Clearing Member’s TARGET2 Account (or the relevant cash account of its
TARGET2 Payment Agent) provided the amount to be credited would not
result in:
(x) the House Margin Requirement exceeding the Margin Balance for the
House Margin Account; and
(y) in respect of a Clearing Member that is a CCM: the CCM Client
Collateral Buffer falling below its CCM Client Collateral Buffer
Threshold.
LCH SA will credit the relevant amount of such excess Euro denominated
Cash Collateral at the next Post-Initial Slot.
A Clearing Member must notify LCH SA of its request to have Euro
denominated Cash Collateral automatically credited to the Clearing
Member’s TARGET2 Account (or the relevant cash account of its TARGET2
Payment Agent) by submitting the relevant form by any means as specified
in a Clearing Notice by no later than 16:00 CET on a Business Day in order
for the Clearing Member’s request to be processed on the next following
Business Day.
Once a Clearing Member has notified LCH SA of its request to have Euro
denominated Cash Collateral automatically credited, LCH SA will apply it,
until such time as LCH SA has been otherwise instructed by the relevant
Clearing Member.
2- A Clearing Member may request, on an ad hoc basis, LCH SA to return
Euro denominated Cash Collateral recorded in its House Collateral Account
to the Clearing Member’s TARGET2 Account (or the relevant cash account

(y) in respect of a Clearing Member that is a CCM: the CCM Client
Collateral Buffer falling below its CCM Client Collateral Buffer
Threshold,
as determined at the time when the request is received and processed by

3- Where a CCM wishes to have Euro denominated Cash Collateral
recorded as CCM Client Collateral Buffer in its CCM House Collateral
Account returned to its TARGET2 Account (or the relevant cash account of
its TARGET2 Payment Agent), it shall first reduce its CCM Client Collateral
Buffer Threshold by sending the relevant form to LCH SA in accordance with
Section 2 of the Procedures. LCH SA will then recalculate the CCM Margin
Balance for that CCM House Margin Account so that any CCM Client
Collateral Buffer that is in excess of the CCM Client Collateral Buffer
Threshold will be treated as CCM House Excess Collateral, allowing the CCM
to request LCH SA to return that CCM House Excess Collateral in accordance
with sub-paragraph 1 or sub-paragraph 2 of this Paragraph 3.7(g) i).
ii)
In respect of a CCM’s Client Collateral Account(s)
A CCM may request LCH SA to return Euro denominated Cash Collateral
recorded in any of its CCM Client Collateral Accounts provided the amount to
be returned would not result in:
(x) the relevant CCM Client Margin Requirement(s), plus
(y) the CCM Allocated Client Collateral Buffer, if any,
exceeding the Margin Balance for the relevant CCM Client Account Structure,
as determined at the time when the request is received and processed by
LCH SA. Where this would be the case, the Clearing Member's request will be
rejected.
Following receipt of a request in accordance with this Paragraph 3.7(g) ii),
LCH SA will credit the relevant amount of Euro denominated Cash Collateral
to the relevant TARGET2 Account of the Clearing Member (or the relevant

Collateral and Cash Payment
The LCH Group Risk Collateral Policy sets out, amongst other things, the principles
that LCH SA must adhere to when arranging for the custody of Cash Collateral and is
kept under review by the Risk Committee. One of those principles is that LCH SA may
select a commercial bank to act as custodian for Cash Collateral, subject to it
meeting the following criteria:
 an average credit rating of at least A-, or a guarantee from a sovereign
government or parent company with an average credit rating of at least A-.
Where there is a subsequent downgrade of the bank's credit rating,
reference will be made to the LCH Group Risk Collateral Policy and the Risk
Committee's policy; and
 has demonstrable operational suitability (confirmed by LCH SA’s own due
diligence).
On the basis of these criteria, LCH SA has selected:
i) Euroclear Bank to act as depository of non-Euro denominated Cash Collateral
provided by Clearing Members; and
ii) BNYM US to act as depository of USD Cash Collateral provided by FCM
Clearing Members on behalf of their FCM Clients,
together referred to as the “Eligible Commercial Banks” and individually as an

ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL
A list of the securities that constitute Eligible Collateral, together with applicable haircuts, is
set out on the Website at http://www.lch.com/risk-collateral-management/collateral-
management/acceptable-collateral.
LCH SA may amend this list in accordance with Article 4.2.7.1 of the CDS Clearing Rule Book
and this Paragraph 3.9.
For risk management purposes, LCH SA does not permit a Clearing Member to transfer “self-
issued securities” as Eligible Collateral (i.e. securities issued by such Clearing Member or by
any of its Affiliates).
(a)
Withholding tax
Each Clearing Member should ensure that the Eligible Collateral submitted to LCH
SA's accounts with custodians or Central Securities Depositories or transferred to
LCH SA’s pledged account at Euroclear Bank pursuant to a collateral arrangement, or
BNYM US pursuant to a security arrangement, is not subject to withholding tax.
If the Eligible Collateral is subject to withholding tax and a Clearing Member does not
request the return of Eligible Collateral prior to the relevant record date of the
securities to enable the Clearing Member to receive the gross coupon or dividend,
any coupon or dividend will be paid to the Clearing Member by LCH SA net of
withholding tax.
(b)
FX conversion and discounts
A discount shall be applied to the value of Eligible Collateral transferred by a Clearing
Member. The amount of the discount shall be notified on the Website. Such
discounts may be modified at any time and at the sole discretion of LCH SA.
Whenever LCH SA is required to convert non-Euro denominated Eligible Collateral,
transferred by a Clearing Member, to Euros such conversion shall be effected on the
basis of the Applicable Price.
(c)
Events affecting the eligibility of Eligible Collateral
Where a security which constitutes Eligible Collateral is affected by one of the
following events (each, a “Collateral Event” and together, the “Collateral Events”):
i) a suspension from trading of such security by an exchange, or
ii) the public announcement of a take-over bid, public exchange offer, split or
reverse split involving the entity issuing such security,
LCH SA will publish a Clearing Notice on the Website notifying Clearing Members
that such security will no longer constitute Eligible Collateral. The Clearing Notice will
specify the effective date, which shall be no later than 2 Business Days following the
date of the Collateral Event, as of which the securities will no longer constitute
Eligible Collateral.

Where a Clearing Member has transferred such securities to LCH SA with full title or
to LCH SA’s pledged account(s) at Euroclear Bank, or to LCH SA’s segregated
depository account(s) at BNYM US, such Clearing Member should request a return of
the securities in accordance with Paragraph 3.10(c), 3.15 (b) or 3.17 (b), as
appropriate, and transfer alternative Collateral to LCH SA in accordance with this
Section 3 to satisfy any of its Margin Requirements and its obligation in respect of its
House Excess Collateral Threshold.
Where the Clearing Member does not request a return of the securities and/or
transfer alternative Collateral to LCH SA prior to the effective date specified in the
Clearing Notice published in accordance with this Paragraph 3.9(c), LCH SA will
calculate the Margin Balance of the Clearing Member’s House Collateral Account and
each of its affected Client Collateral Accounts, in accordance with Paragraph 3.2, on
the effective date specified in such Clearing Notice, excluding the suspended
securities. As a result of this calculation LCH SA shall determine whether or not there
is a Margin Shortfall for any Margin Account or in the case of a CCM Gross Omnibus
Segregated Account Structure, for all the CCM Client Margin Accounts attached to
that CCM Gross Omnibus Segregated Account Structure, of the Clearing Member.
Where there is a Margin Shortfall this will be detailed in the AC0103E Report which is
sent to the Clearing Member in accordance with Paragraph 5.13(b) of Section 5 of
the Procedures and LCH SA shall be taken into account for the purposes of
calculating the Required Collateral Amount for the purposes of the Morning Call on
the next Business Day.
For the avoidance of doubt, LCH SA shall retain the suspended securities until such
time as the Clearing Member requests their return in accordance with this Paragraph
3.9(c) but they shall not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating any
Margin Balance of the Clearing Member on subsequent Business Days.
(d)
Transfer of Eligible Collateral (other than US T-Bills transferred by an FCM Clearing
Member on behalf of FCM Clients)
Subject to the requirement applicable to US T-Bills transferred by an FCM Clearing
Member on behalf of FCM Clients as set out in Paragraph 3.9 (e) below, a Clearing
Member can transfer Eligible Collateral to LCH SA, either:
(e)
i) with full title, in accordance with Paragraph 3.10 to be recorded in its House
Collateral Account and the case of a CCM only, in any of its CCM Client

transfer of Client Pledged Eligible Collateral shall be undertaken in accordance with this
Paragraph 3.16 and the CDS Clearing Documentation.
(a)
Transfer of Client Pledged Eligible Collateral to LCH SA
In order to transfer Client Pledged Eligible Collateral to LCH SA, in order to satisfy a
request made in accordance with Article 4.3.2.1(i) of the CDS Clearing Rule Book, the
Defaulting Clearing Member must provide LCH SA with its consent to the debit of
Client Pledged Eligible Collateral from its Client Pledged Account by Euroclear,
pursuant to an instruction of LCH SA, and credit of the Client Pledged Eligible
Collateral to be credited to the LCH Client Securities Account. The Defaulting Clearing
Member must evidence its consent by submitting the relevant form by any means as
specified in a Clearing Notice.
Following the receipt of the consent of the Defaulting Clearing Member, LCH SA will
submit instructions via Euroclear Bank. When LCH SA receives the confirmation of
settlement from Euroclear Bank or Euroclear France, as applicable, LCH SA shall
update the relevant CCM Client Collateral Account(s) of the Defaulting Clearing
Member to reflect that such Eligible Collateral has been transferred with full title to
LCH SA.
Provided the Defaulting Clearing Member has sent its consent in accordance with

Collateral and Cash Payment
4.3.2.1(i), the Defaulting Clearing Member shall be treated as having satisfied its
obligation to transfer ownership in the Client Pledged Eligible Collateral to LCH SA as
required by the CDS Admission Agreement. If, however, the Defaulting Clearing
Member has not sent its consent within the timeframe specified by LCH SA pursuant
to Article 4.3.2.1(i), LCH SA shall be entitled to enforce the security interest granted
to it under, and in accordance with, the Pledge Agreement and, in accordance with
the CDS Clearing Rule Book by appropriation of the Defaulting Clearing Member’s
Client Pledged Eligible Collateral.
(b)
Transfer of Eligible Collateral to the Backup Clearing Member
On the day prior to the registration of the Relevant Client Cleared Transactions and
the Ported Collateral in the CCM Client Account Structure of the Backup Clearing
Member, in accordance with the CDS Client Clearing DMP, LCH SA will update its
books and records so that the Eligible Collateral recorded in the LCH Client Securities
Account is recorded as Eligible Collateral which has been transferred with full title by
the Backup Clearing Member to be recorded in the relevant CCM Client Collateral
Account(s) of the Backup Clearing Member.
Once the books and records update has been processed, the relevant Eligible
Collateral will form part of the CCM Margin Balance for the relevant CCM Client
Margin Account of the Backup Clearing Member to be taken into account for the
purposes of the Morning Call on the next following Business Day. If the Backup
Clearing Member wishes that such Eligible Collateral be transferred to its relevant
Client Pledged Account, it shall follow the process to substitute the Eligible Collateral
for Pledged Eligible Collateral as set out in Paragraph 3.10(c) and 3.15(a) of this
Section 3.

substituting such Eligible Collateral for any Collateral recorded in its FCM Client
Collateral Account, it shall notify LCH SA of its request to transfer such Eligible
Collateral to the LCH Client Depository Account by submitting the relevant form by

released) to cover the FCM Client Margin Requirement for the relevant
FCM Client Margin Account, LCH SA will reject the FCM Clearing
Member’s request.
LCH SA will send instructions (Sell Free of Payment) submitted via BNYM US and the
FCM Clearing Member shall submit instructions (Buy Free of Payment), for matching

any means the FCM Clearing Members that notifications of movement (transfer or release)
of US T-Bills, for value on Day, must be received by LCH SA on Day minus five before 18.00
CET. Such information will contain the implementation measure of the extension of the

CDS Contractual Currency of the relevant Cleared Transaction(s), in the conditions
and manner as set out in Paragraph 3.18 (d) below.
(b)
Cash Payments in Euro
With respect to a Clearing Member’s Cleared Transactions with a CDS Contractual
Currency in Euro, the relevant Clearing Member is required to satisfy the associated
Cash Payment obligations through TARGET2. Where a Clearing Member is required
to make a Cash Payment in Euro, its relevant TARGET2 Account(s) (or the relevant
cash account(s) of its TARGET2 Payment Agent) will be automatically debited by
LCH SA using its Power of Attorney.
Where a Clearing Member is due to receive a Cash Payment in Euro, its relevant
TARGET2 Account(s) (or the relevant cash account(s) of its TARGET2 Payment
Agent) will be automatically credited by LCH SA using its Power of Attorney.
(c)
Cash Payments in USD
With respect to a Clearing Member’s Cleared Transactions with a CDS Contractual
Currency in USD, LCH SA will require such Clearing Member to satisfy the
associated Cash Payment obligations in USD. For the purpose of making or
receiving Cash Payments in USD, LCH SA will use the following accounts opened in
its name in the books of BNYM US:
(i) a cash account used to debit or credit USD to satisfy Cash Payments
obligations in USD with respect to all relevant House Cleared Transactions of
each Clearing Member (the “LCH House BNYM Account”);
(ii) with respect to Clients of a Clearing Member:
(x) a cash account used to debit or credit USD to satisfy Cash Payments
obligations in USD with respect to all relevant Client Cleared
Transactions of each CCM (the “LCH CCM Client BNYM Account”); or
(y) a cash account used to debit or credit USD to satisfy Cash Payments
obligations in USD with respect to all relevant Client Cleared
Transactions of each FCM Clearing Member (the “LCH FCM Client
BNYM Account”),
together referred to as the “LCH Client BNYM Accounts” and individually as
a “LCH Client BNYM Account”.

Published on 11 December 2017CDS Clearing Procedures
Collateral and Cash Payment
The LCH House BNYM Account and the LCH Client BNYM Accounts shall be
together referred to as the “LCH BNYM Accounts”.
For the purpose of satisfying its Cash Payments obligations in USD, a Clearing
Member shall open, or use a Payment Agent having, one or more cash account(s)
in the books of BNYM US (the “BNYM Accounts”).
A CCM has no obligation to hold two BNYM Accounts (or arrange its Payment
Agent to hold two cash account(s)) for the purposes of satisfying its Cash
Payments obligations in respect of (i) its House Cleared Transactions and (ii) its
Client Cleared Transactions. It may either:
(x) hold one BNYM Account (or one cash account of its Payment Agent), in
which case such BNYM Account will be used for the debits and credits
made out of both the LCH House BNYM Account and the LCH Client
BNYM Account; or
(y) hold two BNYM Accounts (or two cash accounts of its Payment Agent),
in which case one BNYM Account will be used for the debits and credits
made out of the LCH House BNYM Account and the other will be used
for the debits and credits made out of the LCH Client BNYM Account.
An FCM Clearing Member has an obligation to hold two BNYM Accounts (or arrange
its Payment Agent to hold two cash account(s)) for the purposes of satisfying its
Cash Payments obligations in respect of (i) its House Cleared Transactions and (ii) its
Client Cleared Transactions. Therefore, an FCM Clearing Member will hold two
BNYM Accounts (or two cash accounts of its Payment Agent), in which case one
BNYM Account will be used for the debits and credits made out of the LCH House
BNYM Account and the other will be used for the debits and credits made out of
the LCH FCM Client BNYM Account.
If a Clearing Member wishes to add a new BNYM Account or replace an existing
BNYM Account with another, it may do so by providing LCH SA with the details of
the relevant BNYM Account with at least 15 days’ prior notice (unless otherwise
agreed by LCH SA).
Where a Clearing Member is required to make a Cash Payment in USD, its relevant
BNYM Account(s) (or the relevant cash account(s) of its Payment Agent) will be
automatically debited by LCH SA using its Power of Attorney.
Where a Clearing Member is due to receive a Cash Payment in USD, its relevant
BNYM Account(s) (or the relevant cash account(s) of its BNYM Payment Agent) will
be automatically credited by LCH SA using its Power of Attorney.
(d)
Timing for Cash Payments
Debiting or crediting the TARGET2 Account(s) or BNYM Account(s) will occur on
each Cash Payment Day, at the times of the Initial Slot and Post-Initial Slot set out
in Paragraph 3.7(c) above with the exception that crediting any BNYM Account(s)
of a Clearing Member will occur by no later than 16:30 CET on that Cash Payment
Day.

Collateral and Cash Payment
In the event that:
(i) any BNYM Account(s) of a Clearing Member cannot be debited within the
time slots set out above in this Paragraph 3.18 (d); and
(ii) such Clearing Member has not made its Cash Payments in USD during the
Initial Slot by 10:00 CET,
such Clearing Member shall be required to satisfy such Cash Payments obligations
in Euro through TARGET2 at the time of the First Intraday Slot as set out in
Paragraph 3.7 (c) above except that, when such debiting related to Cash Payments
made by an FCM Clearing Member in respect of Client Variation Margin
Requirements, it will occur between 11:30-12:00 CET. LCH SA shall convert the USD
amount in respect of such Cash Payment obligation into a Euro amount at the FX
rate dealt by LCH SA on the market and shall notify the relevant Clearing Member
of such Euro amount in accordance with, subject to and at the times set out in
Section 5 of the Procedures. The relevant Clearing Member will be liable for costs
incurred by LCH SA in connection with the conversion of those Cash Payments
initially due in USD into Euro, that will be debited from the relevant TARGET2
Account(s) of that Clearing Member (or the relevant cash account(s) of its TARGET2
Payment Agent).
Once the relevant cash amount is debited by LCH SA, it will satisfy the Clearing
Member’s Cash Payment obligations.
