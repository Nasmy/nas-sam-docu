</s><s><s><s>Monique Maddy and Côme Laguë formed African Communications Group (ACG) after graduating from the Harvard Business School in 1993. They planned to install a pay-phone system in Dar es Salaam and provide paging and voice-mail services to the business community.</s> </s><s><s><s>Maddy and Laguë started ACG in 1993 with a team of HBS students to build a pay-phone network in Tanzania. They developed a business plan, obtained financing, purchased operating licenses and contracted with equipment suppliers. Despite their success to date, ACG faced significant challenges in early 1996. Regulators in Tanzania and other African countries were issuing telecommunications licenses to a number of companies.</s> </s><s>Tanzania had 78,000 telephone lines for a population of 27 million people at the end of 1992. 80% of these lines were concentrated in Dar es Salaam, where about 7% of the population lived. In rural areas, one line was available per 2,000 people. 153,000 potential subscribers had applied for private telephone service but had not yet received it.</s> </s><s><s><s>one service was forecast at nearly 500,000 potential subscribers. A planned US$220 million in infrastructure improvements would double the number of available telephone lines by the end of 1997, but demand for private telephone lines would still be high. Dale O. Coxe prepared the case under the supervision of Assistant Professor Anita McGahan. Julia Kou provided additional research assistance.</s> </s><s><s>The infrastructure that supported the country's private telephone lines was antiquated and poorly maintained. Some private telephone subscribers offered their phones to the public for calls at rates up to 2,000% above their costs. About 300 coin-operated pay phones were located across Tanzania. Most were defective and needed to be replaced.</s> </s><s><s><s>The ACG pay phone system was innovative because it did not require copper wire between outstations and ACG’s central platform. The central platform contained all card information and allowed ACG personnel to manage and monitor the phone system from the central office.</s> </s><s><s><s>ACG cards are used to make phone calls lasting a specific number of minutes. Retailers bought cards from ACG at an average discount of 14% off face values. The newly purchased card was sealed in a wrapper to indicate that it was unused. Instructions on card use were printed on the wrapper in both Kiswahili and English.</s> </s><s><s><s>ACG’s central station analyzes a card to determine its validity and value. The card's destination, the price of the call and the length of time the caller can talk are based on the card's value. If there was insufficient value, the call did not proceed.</s>
