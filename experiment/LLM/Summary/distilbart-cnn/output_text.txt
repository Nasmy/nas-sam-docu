</s><s> African Communications Group (ACG) was about to install a pay-phone system in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Maddy and Laguë formed ACG after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1993. They believed that Africa was the last major geographic market yet to experience significant growth in the communications sector.</s> </s><s> Maddy and a team of six HBS students identified a pay-phone network as the most promising opportunity. Tanzania was chosen for its relatively stable political environment and its overwhelming need for additional telephone service. Despite their success to date, ACG faced significant challenges in early 1996.</s> </s><s> At the end of 1992, Tanzania had approximately 78,000 telephone lines for a population of about 27 million people. Some 80% of these lines were concentrated in Dar es Salaam, where about 7% of the population lived. Many towns and villages did not have access to telecommunications services at all.</s> </s><s> One service, both official and unofficial, was forecast at nearly 500,000 potential subscribers. One planned US$220 million in infrastructure improvements would double the number of available lines by the end of 1997.

Some private telephone subscribers offered their phones to the public at rates up to 2,000% above their costs. The success rate on a call averaged between 25% and 45%.</s> </s><s> Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) operated the country’s basic wireline telephone system. A typical call from an ACG pay phone would typically be transmitted via copper cable to a nearby outstation. Each outstation could be connected with up to 10 pay phones. The system was innovative because it did not require copper wire between outstations and the central platform.</s> </s><s> Retailers purchased cards from ACG at an average discount of 14% off face values. 500 and 1,000 cards would be used for local calls; 2,000 and 5,000 for long distance; 20,000 calls for international calls.Instructions on card use were printed on the wrapper in both Kiswahili and English.</s> </s><s>ination number were transmitted from the pay phone by wireless to ACG’s central station. There, a computer analyzed the card to determine its validity and value. Once the analysis was completed, the caller received a voice prompt, first in Kiswahili and then in English, to dial the desired number.</s>
