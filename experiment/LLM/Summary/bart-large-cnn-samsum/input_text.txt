African Communications Group
In February 1996, Monique Maddy, president and chief executive officer of the African
Communications Group (ACG), and Côme Laguë, chief operating officer, completed a review of
ACG’s projects in Tanzania. After more than three years of planning, ACG was about to install a pay-
phone system in Tanzania’s largest city, Dar es Salaam. Tanzania had the highest backlog in Africa
for telephone services. ACG’s system would be based on wireless radio technology. Callers would
prepay for service by purchasing cards that would activate ACG’s pay phones. ACG also planned to
offer paging and voice-mail services to Tanzania’s burgeoning business community.
Maddy and Laguë formed ACG after graduating from the Harvard Business School in 1993.
They believed that Africa was the last major geographic market yet to experience significant growth
in the communications sector. Maddy and Laguë envisioned that their firm would eventually provide
a wide range of media and communications services across the continent. Tanzania had been chosen
as ACG’s entry point for its relatively stable political environment and its overwhelming need for
additional telephone service. After three months of on-site research in 1993, Maddy and a team of six
HBS students identified a pay-phone network as the most promising opportunity. Maddy and Laguë
then developed a business plan, obtained financing, purchased operating licenses, and contracted
with equipment suppliers. Despite their success to date, ACG faced significant challenges in early
1996. Regulators in Tanzania and other African countries were issuing telecommunications licenses to
a number of companies, and private enterprise was growing rapidly. Maddy and Laguë knew they
would have to move quickly if they were to achieve their goal of a continent-wide system.
ACG Card Phone and Paging Services
In the mid-1990s, telecommunications in Tanzania was considered a luxury rather than a
utility. As in most other African countries, private investment in telecommunications had been
minimal and most service was delivered by a state agency. Years of neglect resulted in a sparse
terrestrial network with congestion, high fault rates, and obsolete equipment. At the end of 1992,
Tanzania had approximately 78,000 telephone lines for a population of about 27 million people. Some
80% of these lines were concentrated in Dar es Salaam, where about 7% of the population lived. In
Dar es Salaam, one telephone line had been installed per hundred residents. In rural areas, one line
was available per two thousand residents on average. Many towns and villages did not have access
to telecommunications services at all.
According to the Tanzanian telecommunications authority, 153,000 potential subscribers had
applied for private telephone service but had not yet received it. Applicants waited from 7 to 10 years
for service hook-ups. “Unofficial” demand from individuals who had not applied for service was
thought to be equally high and growing rapidly. By the end of 1996, the demand for private
telephone service—both official and unofficial—was forecast at nearly 500,000 potential subscribers.
Research Associate Dale O. Coxe prepared this case under the supervision of Assistant Professor Anita McGahan as the
basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation. Julia
Kou provided additional research assistance.

Although a planned US$220 million in infrastructure improvements would double the number of
available lines by the end of 1997, demand for private telephone lines would not be satisfied.
The infrastructure that supported the country’s private telephone lines was antiquated and
poorly maintained. Line problems and broken parts meant that many subcriber lines either did not
work or worked intermittently. Some private telephone subscribers offered their phones to the public
for calls at rates up to 2,000% above their costs. The success rate on a call averaged between 25% and
45%. In most areas, the caller had to wait several minutes before receiving a dial tone; once a dial tone
was obtained, it could take 40 minutes to reach other cities within Africa and 20 minutes to connect
with Europe. In addition to private telephones, approximately 300 coin-operated pay phones were
located across Tanzania. Most were defective and needed to be replaced. The country’s high inflation
rate also meant many working pay phones were configured to accept coins that were no longer in
circulation.
Card-Operated Pay Phone
The ACG pay-phone system had four basic elements: card-operated phones, a radio system
for transmitting calls, a central platform at ACG headquarters for routing calls, and a connection
between the central platform and the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL). TTCL
operated the country’s basic wireline telephone system. A typical call from an ACG pay phone would
be transmitted via copper cable to a nearby outstation. Each outstation could be connected with up to
10 pay phones. The outstation would transmit the call via radio signal to ACG’s headquarters in Dar
es Salaam. The central platform would then route the call to TTCL, where it would be directed to a
local, long-distance, or international destination. The system was innovative because it did not
require copper wire between outstations and ACG’s central platform. (See Exhibit 1.) The central
platform contained all card information and allowed ACG personnel to continuously manage and
monitor the phone system from the central office.
ACG pay phones were activated by inserting a card that had been pre-programmed to allow
the holder to make phone calls lasting a specific number of minutes. These cards could be purchased
in a variety of values from retail establishments that were located near phone booths. Retailers
purchased cards from ACG at an average discount of 14% off face values. Cards were available with
face values of US$0.87, US$1.74, US$3.47, US$8.68, and US$34.72 which corresponded to values of
500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 20,000 Tanzanian shillings. 1 ACG managers believed that the kind of call
a customer wished to make would govern the kind of card purchased. Generally, 500 and 1,000 cards
would be used for local calls; 2,000 and 5,000 cards for long distance; and 20,000 cards for
international calls.
The newly purchased card was sealed in a wrapper to indicate that it was unused.
Instructions on card use—how to insert the card, lift the hand set, and listen for instructions—were
printed on the wrapper in both Kiswahili and English, the two predominant languages in Tanzania. 2
The card information and the destination number were transmitted from the pay phone by wireless
radio to ACG’s central station. There, a computer analyzed the card to determine its validity and
value. Once the analysis was completed, the caller received a voice prompt, first in Kiswahili and
then in English, to dial the desired number.
After the number was dialed, the central station’s computer analyzed the number to
determine its destination, the price of the call, and the length of time the caller could talk given the
value on the card. A voice prompt provided the customer with this information. If there was
insufficient value on the card to make the call, the caller was informed. If there was sufficient value,
the call proceeded. Once a card’s value was exhausted, the holder would throw it away.
