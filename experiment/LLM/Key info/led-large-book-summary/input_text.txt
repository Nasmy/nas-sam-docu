In February 1996, Monique Maddy, president and chief executive officer of the African
Communications Group (ACG), and Côme Laguë, chief operating officer, completed a review of
ACG’s projects in Tanzania. After more than three years of planning, ACG was about to install a pay-
phone system in Tanzania’s largest city, Dar es Salaam. Tanzania had the highest backlog in Africa
for telephone services. ACG’s system would be based on wireless radio technology. Callers would
prepay for service by purchasing cards that would activate ACG’s pay phones. ACG also planned to
offer paging and voice-mail services to Tanzania’s burgeoning business community.
Maddy and Laguë formed ACG after graduating from the Harvard Business School in 1993.
They believed that Africa was the last major geographic market yet to experience significant growth
in the communications sector. Maddy and Laguë envisioned that their firm would eventually provide
a wide range of media and communications services across the continent. Tanzania had been chosen
as ACG’s entry point for its relatively stable political environment and its overwhelming need for
additional telephone service. After three months of on-site research in 1993, Maddy and a team of six
HBS students identified a pay-phone network as the most promising opportunity. Maddy and Laguë
then developed a business plan, obtained financing, purchased operating licenses, and contracted
with equipment suppliers. Despite their success to date, ACG faced significant challenges in early
1996. Regulators in Tanzania and other African countries were issuing telecommunications licenses to
a number of companies, and private enterprise was growing rapidly. Maddy and Laguë knew they
would have to move quickly if they were to achieve their goal of a continent-wide system.
ACG Card Phone and Paging Services
In the mid-1990s, telecommunications in Tanzania was considered a luxury rather than a
utility. As in most other African countries, private investment in telecommunications had been
minimal and most service was delivered by a state agency. Years of neglect resulted in a sparse
terrestrial network with congestion, high fault rates, and obsolete equipment. At the end of 1992,
Tanzania had approximately 78,000 telephone lines for a population of about 27 million people. Some
80% of these lines were concentrated in Dar es Salaam, where about 7% of the population lived. In
Dar es Salaam, one telephone line had been installed per hundred residents. In rural areas, one line
was available per two thousand residents on average. Many towns and villages did not have access
to telecommunications services at all.
According to the Tanzanian telecommunications authority, 153,000 potential subscribers had
applied for private telephone service but had not yet received it. Applicants waited from 7 to 10 years
for service hook-ups. “Unofficial” demand from individuals who had not applied for service was
thought to be equally high and growing rapidly. By the end of 1996, the demand for private
telephone service—both official and unofficial—was forecast at nearly 500,000 potential subscribers.
Research Associate Dale O. Coxe prepared this case under the supervision of Assistant Professor Anita McGahan as the
basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation. Julia
Kou provided additional research assistance.

Although a planned US$220 million in infrastructure improvements would double the number of
available lines by the end of 1997, demand for private telephone lines would not be satisfied.
The infrastructure that supported the country’s private telephone lines was antiquated and
poorly maintained. Line problems and broken parts meant that many subcriber lines either did not
work or worked intermittently. Some private telephone subscribers offered their phones to the public
for calls at rates up to 2,000% above their costs. The success rate on a call averaged between 25% and
45%. In most areas, the caller had to wait several minutes before receiving a dial tone; once a dial tone
was obtained, it could take 40 minutes to reach other cities within Africa and 20 minutes to connect
with Europe. In addition to private telephones, approximately 300 coin-operated pay phones were
located across Tanzania. Most were defective and needed to be replaced. The country’s high inflation
rate also meant many working pay phones were configured to accept coins that were no longer in
circulation.
Card-Operated Pay Phone
The ACG pay-phone system had four basic elements: card-operated phones, a radio system
for transmitting calls, a central platform at ACG headquarters for routing calls, and a connection
between the central platform and the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL). TTCL
operated the country’s basic wireline telephone system. A typical call from an ACG pay phone would
be transmitted via copper cable to a nearby outstation. Each outstation could be connected with up to
10 pay phones. The outstation would transmit the call via radio signal to ACG’s headquarters in Dar
es Salaam. The central platform would then route the call to TTCL, where it would be directed to a
local, long-distance, or international destination. The system was innovative because it did not
require copper wire between outstations and ACG’s central platform. (See Exhibit 1.) The central
platform contained all card information and allowed ACG personnel to continuously manage and
monitor the phone system from the central office.
ACG pay phones were activated by inserting a card that had been pre-programmed to allow
the holder to make phone calls lasting a specific number of minutes. These cards could be purchased
in a variety of values from retail establishments that were located near phone booths. Retailers
purchased cards from ACG at an average discount of 14% off face values. Cards were available with
face values of US$0.87, US$1.74, US$3.47, US$8.68, and US$34.72 which corresponded to values of
500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 20,000 Tanzanian shillings. 1 ACG managers believed that the kind of call
a customer wished to make would govern the kind of card purchased. Generally, 500 and 1,000 cards
would be used for local calls; 2,000 and 5,000 cards for long distance; and 20,000 cards for
international calls.
The newly purchased card was sealed in a wrapper to indicate that it was unused.
Instructions on card use—how to insert the card, lift the hand set, and listen for instructions—were
printed on the wrapper in both Kiswahili and English, the two predominant languages in Tanzania. 2
The card information and the destination number were transmitted from the pay phone by wireless
radio to ACG’s central station. There, a computer analyzed the card to determine its validity and
value. Once the analysis was completed, the caller received a voice prompt, first in Kiswahili and
then in English, to dial the desired number.
After the number was dialed, the central station’s computer analyzed the number to
determine its destination, the price of the call, and the length of time the caller could talk given the
value on the card. A voice prompt provided the customer with this information. If there was
insufficient value on the card to make the call, the caller was informed. If there was sufficient value,
the call proceeded. Once a card’s value was exhausted, the holder would throw it away.
1 In January 1996, US $1.00 = approximately 576 Tanzanian shillings.
2 Approximately 30% of Tanzania’s population spoke English as its first language or language of choice.

Paging
ACG’s management believed that the wireless radio system would easily support paging and
voice-mail services at very low incremental cost. Paging and voice mail would have great appeal in
Tanzania because they would allow quick communication to parties that did not subscribe to private
phone service. Voice mail would allow a mailbox subscriber to receive messages and to leave
messages for other mailbox subscribers. For an additional fee, a voice mailbox would also be linked
to a pager that signaled the subscriber when a message was received.
ACG’s management envisioned that subscribers would send and retrieve messages through
ACG’s pay phones. The extra hardware required to operate the paging and voice-mail systems
would be housed in ACG’s central office. Initially, ACG expected to use a stand-alone billing system
to collect subscriber fees on pagers. It estimated that paging and voice mail could double pay-phone
usage. Eventually, the central platform for the pay-phone system would also be used to manage the
paging and voice-mail systems.
Customers
In 1992, there were an estimated 4.7 million households in Tanzania. The population had
grown at an annual rate of 3% between 1968 and 1988. Growth was projected to continue in this
range. Dar es Salaam was located on the country’s eastern coast. Its location made it the primary port
for landlocked countries in central Africa. Overall, however, Tanzania’s urbanization was low, with
only 19% of the nation’s 27 million inhabitants living in towns and 7% of the population living in Dar
es Salaam.
Tanzania’s economy was primarily agricultural. In 1994, over 50% of its GDP was produced
in the agricultural sector (see Exhibit 2). Approximately 80% of the population depended on
agriculture, fisheries and related sectors for its livelihood. Estimated GDP per capita for 1995 was less
than US$139. The country’s 90% literacy rate and 51-year average life expectancy were high
compared to other sub-saharan countries.
Tanzania’s infrastructure was uniformly poor. In addition to inadequate telephone service,
electricity and water services were irregular and unpredictable. Many primary roads were either
unpaved or in poor condition and travel was difficult: in mid-1995, it took three days to travel from
Dar es Salaam to Mwanza, Tanzania’s second largest city, located 751 miles away.
Much of Tanzania’s commerce was conducted in person. People traveled to make and to
confirm appointments, to order supplies, to learn whether products were available, and to
communicate with family members. A woman ordering a dress, for example, would have to visit the
dressmaker as many as five times before receiving the product. The first and second trips would be
required to schedule and complete a fitting, the third trip to approve the fabric after it had been
received by the dressmaker, and the fourth and fifth trips to obtain the product. Extra trips were
required because the dressmaker was not home or was behind schedule, and had no way of notifying
the customer to delay her visit.
Within cities, the majority of telephone calls were made by business people. About 70% of
telecommunications revenue was received from business subscribers, 20% by government
organizations, and 10% from residential subscribers. Businesses used telephones to maintain contact
with branch offices and to receive information from travelling employees. Businesses also used
phones to communicate with customers and suppliers. (See Exhibits 2 and 3 for information on
Tanzanian commerce.) The shortage of private, residential phone service meant that business
telephone misuse was common. To minimize misuse, many businesses restricted phones to local
calls. Employees were required to use pay phones for all types of long-distance calls.
Telephone subscriptions were more common among businesses in the agricultural and
transportation sectors than in the retail sector. Most retailers dealing in food and household items did
not have telephones. Retail shops, known as dukas, were densely clustered along urban and rural
streets. The dukas were small make-shift open-air stalls made of wood and tin. Although each duka

sold only a few products, they were a major source of commercial activity in aggregate. ACG
managers believed that card phone, paging, and voice-mail services would provide these small
establishments and their customers with more efficient ways of doing business.
Banks had telephones but did not permit customers to use them. Since the Tanzanian
economy was essentially a cash economy—credit cards and cheques were rarely accepted—banking
customers often deposited or withdrew large amounts of cash. It was customary for a business
courier who carried cash to inform his client that he had reached a bank safely or that he was leaving
the bank with money. ACG planned to place phones in banks and commercial centers to satisfy this
demand.
Most transport companies had little contact with drivers once goods were picked up at urban
depots. The cost of radios was significant and only a few companies could afford to use them. A
widespread network of pay phones throughout Tanzania would allow truckers to confirm that
deliveries had reached their destinations.
In 1996, airports, hospitals, ports, and educational institutions did not have public pay
phones. These locations were high traffic areas for both residential and business callers, and ACG’s
management believed that demand at such facilities would be robust.
Most residential calls were placed to locations within Tanzania. It was common for one
family member to migrate to Dar es Salaam for work while the rest of the family lived in a village at a
subsistence level. Since the city worker often provided income for an entire family, there was demand
for communication links between urban and rural areas. Many villages, however, had either no
phone or only a small number of phones. News between family members was conveyed through
prearranged calls or personal visits.
Demand for pay phones would also arise among some middle-and high-income customers
who wanted to make international calls to Europe, Asia, or the United States. People in
transit—tourists, expatriates, business travelers—also would use the pay-phone system to make
international calls. Eighty percent of Tanzania’s international travelers connected through Dar es
Salaam.
A study of pay-phone usage in Dar es Salaam showed that approximately 150 three-minute
calls were made each day at each of the 60 working phones already operated by companies other
than ACG. The total amount of money spent each day on calls per phone was approximately US$100-
$150. A poll of customers indicated that 65% were using pay phones because they did not have access
to another working phone. Sixty-three percent of customers surveyed were in business occupations,
20% were students or teachers (defined as non-business customers), and 17% were other non-
business customers. Some 71% of pay-phone users were residents of Dar es Salaam; 12% were
tourists; and 17% were other non-residents. The average amount spent per week on public pay
phone calls was US$10.00 per week for business customers and US$6.00 per week for non-business
customers, with business customers making an average of 14 calls per week from pay phones and
non-business customers making 12 calls per week. 3
The Telecommunications Industry
Like some of its neighbors, Tanzania operated under a socialist system of government from
the mid-1960’s to the mid-1980’s. During this period, the state nationalized and dominated most
sectors of the economy, including banking, insurance, trade, and telecommunications. Many large
agricultural estates were nationalized when the government embarked on a process of “villagization”
or “ujama” to relocate large portions of the population to rural areas. GDP grew approximately 5%
per year and inflation grew 10% from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. In 1978, war with Idi Amin’s
Uganda and a simultaneous rise in oil prices rapidly consumed Tanzania’s limited supply of hard
currency and devastated the economy. Between 1980 and 1987, per capita GNP decreased at an
3 African Communications Group survey of pay-phone users in Dar es Salaam.

average annual rate of 1.8% while inflation exceeded 23%. Production of major cash crops declined,
official development assistance fell dramatically, and private capital investment dropped to near
zero. By 1990, Tanzania ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per capita of
US$105.
In the mid-1980s, Tanzania sought help from both the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank. Under the resulting Economic Recovery Program, Tanzania liberalized import
restrictions, freed producer prices and interest rates, devalued the Tanzanian shilling, and reduced
state involvement in industry. In 1990, the government implemented a second set of reforms called
the Economic and Social Action Program (ESAP). ESAP attached priority to infrastructure
development, with particular emphasis on transportation and telecommunications. In 1990 the
government also enacted the National Investment Act, which provided investors with “investment
guarantees, application procedures, and incentives.” Investments approved by the Act’s Investment
Promotion Center (IPC) qualified for five-year “tax holidays,” waivers of import duty and sales tax
for equipment used in the business, and the right to retain at least 50% of foreign exchange earnings
in external accounts. The Banking and Financial Institutions Act (1991) created a legal framework for
competitive banking and other financial services.
In January 1992, the government enacted legislation aimed at restructuring state agencies: the
telecommunications authority and other commercial agencies were to be privatized. To attract
foreign investment in the newly privatized companies, the Foreign Exchange Act of 1992 removed
foreign exchange controls for individuals and companies doing business in Tanzania. The Bureau of
Exchange could buy and sell at market rates; individuals could establish foreign currency accounts at
any bank without central bank clearance; and foreign shareholders could export or transfer share
certificates to new subsidiaries without advising the central bank. Tanzania also joined both the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the International Center for Settlement of
Investment Disputes. 4 Although Tanzania made substantial progress in economic reform, at the close
of 1995 it still remained one of Africa’s largest state economies.
Telecommunications Infrastructure
The Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (TPTC) was a state-owned
enterprise established in 1977 after the break-up of its predecessor organization. It was staffed by a
huge bureacracy and held a monopoly on mail and telecommunications services until the early 1990s.
Of TPTC’s 5,000 staff members, less than 2% were graduate engineers. TPTC did not offer paging,
fax, cellular, or data-network services. In the early 1990s, it faced only modest competition. One
private radio-call service, with a base of 105 subscribers, had stations at Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, and
Arusha. A private paging service, consisting of one transmitter and 30 receivers, was located at
KCMC Hospital in Dar es Salaam. Sound broadcasting in Tanzania was provided by one private
organization and by two government-owned organizations: Radio Tanzania and The Voice of
Tanzania and Zanzibar. By the close of 1995, however, at least three television stations were
broadcasting in Tanzania. There were also several private calling offices, two high-end cellular phone
services, and a local Tanzanian company with 10 card-operated pay phones.
The scarcity of foreign exchange and private capital investment during the 1970s and 1980s
affected the government’s ability to replace, repair, and maintain the country’s telecommunication
infrastructure. Between 1985 and 1987, the government invested an average of $12 million in its
telecommunications sector, an amount equivalent to only 0.3% of its GDP. This level was low by
international standards and lower than that of most other Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries. 5 As of September 1992, the TPTC had identified over US$180 million
priority projects, but had less than US$50 million to spend on them. In addition, charges of
inefficiency and corruption scarred TPTC’s reputation for responsible spending.
4 MIGA protected private investors against certain risks in developing countries. These risks included losses from
currency transfers, expropriation, war, and civil disturbance. MIGA also advised developing countries on foreign
investments and provided a forum for dialogue on investment issues between investors and governments.
5 Other members of SADC included Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe.

Following Tanzania’s commitment to liberalize its economy, a US$220 million, five-year loan
for telecommunications restructuring was obtained from Denmark, Sweden, Japan, the European
Union, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank. The project, which was monitored by the
World Bank, included the repair of more than 12,500 telephone lines and the installation of digital
telephone exchanges, high-capacity transmission systems, and global switches. Industry observers
believed that when these projects were completed, Tanzania’s telecommunication infrastructure
would be significantly improved.
At the close of 1993, TPTC officially split into two separate companies: the Tanzania Posts
Company (TPC) and the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL). The Director of
the TTCL reported to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. TTCL’s responsibilities
included planning, managing, and developing domestic and international public telecommunications
services. It also provided dedicated networks for the police, military, railways, and civil aviation.
Like its predecessor, however, few of TTCL’s more than 4,000 employees were professionals. It
employed approximately 50 engineers and 1,300 technicians. Remaining employees were operations
and support staff. Inefficiency and corruption continued to be serious issues for the company.
Industry observers expected TTCL to be privatized in 1996.
The Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC), established in 1994, provided a “policy
and regulatory framework” for the communications sector in Tanzania. By the end of 1995, it had
issued 2 licenses for cellular services, 5 licenses for paging (including one to ACG), and some 20
licenses for pay-phone services (including one to ACG).
Suppliers
ACG dealt with suppliers in a number of different markets for the equipment necessary to
operate its system. Prices charged by suppliers of telecommunications equipment varied greatly
depending on the intensity of competition, interest in a particular market, and geographic location of
the country to which equipment was shipped. Suppliers generally charged more for equipment
shipped to Africa—routinely adding a 50% surcharge—because few competitors supplied that
market. 6 Service providers with main offices in the United States, however, qualified for U.S. prices,
even when equipment was shipped to Africa.
Because the telecommunications market in many African countries had only recently opened
to private investment, buyers of equipment were eager to negotiate regional exclusivity agreements
with suppliers. Some equipment suppliers favored the agreements because they gave buyers an
incentive to serve as their advocates in new markets. A few suppliers, such as Motorola and AT&T,
hired agents in Tanzania and other countries to sell their equipment. Others entered into partnerships
with local firms. For example, Millicom had entered into a joint venture with TTCL and another
Tanzanian company which sold Motorola equipment. The joint venture, called Mobitel, sold cellular
telephone service in Tanzania. Mobitel’s customers were required to purchase cellular phones made
by Motorola.
ACG selected the equipment for its card-operated pay-phone network from a variety of
suppliers. Systems from AT&T, Landis & Gyr Communications, Schlumberger, Alcatel, and other
manufacturers were evaluated, but the high cost of phone cards and a lack of flexibility made many
of these technologies unattractive. ACG managers chose a Texas-based company called Intellicall as a
principal equipment supplier. The company would manufacture ACG’s pay phones and its central
platform. A Quebec-based company called SR Telecom would provide the radio transmission
equipment necessary to connect pay phones with the central platform. Equipment from these two
suppliers would give ACG the lowest-cost card-phone system in Tanzania. ACG had also contracted
with a number of other companies for booths, plastic cards and other supplies. These additional
contracts reflected competitive terms in commodity markets.
6 Many major telecommunications equipment and services providers and suppliers were focused on emerging
markets in Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe.
6

796-128
Intellicall provided equipment to companies in North America, Latin America, and Asia. The
firm had a reputation as a technology leader in calling networks. Sales had increased from $10.9
million in 1985 to over $85 million in 1994. ACG chose Intellicall’s card phones for their versatility:
the phones could be configured to accept prepaid cards or credit and ATM cards. Cards could be
validated by either magnetic strips or PIN numbers. The phones also could be connected to regular
lines or adapted for cellular systems, and configured to use AC or DC power. The durability of the
units allowed them to be placed in any indoor or outdoor location. ACG’s management believed that
the Intellicall system was unique: its centralized computer technology permitted ACG personnel to
monitor the system from headquarters, a feature not offered by other manufacturers. The upper limit
on the platform’s capacity exceeded ACG’s most agressive scenarios for expansion in Tanzania.
ACG was exploring the possibility of a long-term exclusivity agreement with Intellicall for
several reasons. The unique operating characteristics of the Intellicall platform made it incompatible
with pay phones made by other manufacturers. Intellicall also saw benefits to a long-term agreement
with ACG. To date, Intellicall’s products had been tailored predominantly for Western markets. To
meet its growth objectives, Intellicall was eager to obtain access to new markets. ACG’s configuration
of pay phones with a wireless radio system was a new concept that could be adapted to other
markets. The two companies had signed an agreement that stipulated contingencies on price
increases, payment schedules, and equipment ownership and responsibilities.
SR Telecom was one of two leaders in the market for analog-to-digital, microwave radio
systems for transmitting signals from a single point (e.g., ACG’s radio tower) to multiple points (e.g.,
ACG outstations). The company sold equipment to companies in North America, Europe, Asia, Latin
America, and Africa. It had sales of more than US$100 million in 1994 and held approximately 50% of
world market share in wireless radio equipment. SR Telecom operated large-scale production
facilities and had not customized its equipment for ACG. Its wireless radio system for transmitting
phone calls included the central tower, outstations, and a central station linked to the Intellicall
central platform. The wireless system allowed ACG to operate on only one connection to TTCL’s
network rather than on connections for every phone. The result was that ACG negotiated only one
license and one deposit for service with TTCL rather than separate licenses and deposits for each
phone. The single point of connection also allowed ACG to monitor the line against misuse.
The wireless radio equipment was the most costly segment of the card-operated pay phone
system. Favorable lease-to-buy terms, however, had been negotiated for equipment. At an outstation
price of US$17,043, ACG had to attach 5 pay phones to each outstation to make the installation cost-
effective. Each outstation could support up to 10 phones. In rural areas, the SR Telecom solution
would not be as favorable as it was for Dar es Salaam because rural usage would be insufficient to
support 5 phones. ACG therefore planned its roll-out for Dar es Salaam and several other urban
areas.
Although paging was initially planned as an add-on service, ACG had already selected
Glenayre Electronics as its paging equipment supplier. Like Intellicall, Glenayre saw advantages to a
long-term agreement with ACG: a marriage of pay phone and paging technologies would allow
Glenayre to market paging to a larger segment of the market. Glenayre and Intellicall had agreed to
work with ACG managers to develop an interface between their systems.
Service Distributors
For many years, TTCL and its predecessor, TPTC, were sole distributors of Tanzania’s
telecommunication services. As the country moved to privatize the telecommunications industry,
new service providers had entered the market, and more were expected to follow. Financial resources
and management expertise varied significantly among both bidders and licensees. Initially, AT&T
and other large companies had not applied for licenses. One industry observer suggested that
concerns about cost effectiveness and commitments to other developing markets would keep these
companies out of Africa for several years.
Service distributors had to obtain separate licenses for the right to operate equipment and for
a link to the central phone network controlled by TTCL. Most licenses were obtained from the
Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC) but the license for pay-phone service was issued by

TTCL. 7 The process of submitting a proposal, winning a contract, and obtaining licenses was lengthy.
(Exhibit 4 provides an example of the licensing process.)
Pay Phone Service xxx At the end of 1995, approximately 20 licenses had been issued to prospective
pay-phone operators but only a few companies actually offered the service. Several small companies
operated calling offices at single sites in Dar es Salaam. JCL, a small Tanzanian competitor, owned a
network of 10 card-operated pay phones. TTCL had announced early in the deregulation process that
it planned to exit the pay-phone business. In early 1996, however, the company advertised a tender
for a joint venture pay-phone system. Industry observers believed that it would be mid-1996 before
TTCL analyzed the responses and completed the selection process.
Each pay-phone provider in operation had established a separate physical connection to
TTCL’s network for each pay phone. The result was that phone locations had been constrained by
TTCL’s exchange locations. Separate licenses had been required for each phone. The direct links
between the phones and TTCL meant that pay-phone owners could not track usage through a
computerized system. The pay-phone operator obtained revenue from the coin box or from sales of
phone cards, and incurred operating costs in the form of bills from TTCL. ACG had learned that
TTCL’s bills sometimes included charges for calls that had not been made from the phones. As a
consequence, some pay-phone operators hired monitors to track usage. Discrepancies were identified
through a comparison of monitors’ records with TTCL’s bills. Industry observers suspected that
some pay-phone operators had made special payments to TTCL employees in exchange for
assurances that bills would not be prone to error.
The card-phone technology chosen by JCL relied on a hole punching system that operated on
the card as it was used in a JCL phone. The cards were sold in two values: 1,500 shillings (US$2.63)
and 3,000 shillings (US$5.21). ACG management believed that JCL’s operating margins were about
50% on its lower-value cards, and 60%-75% on its high-value cards. JCL’s technology limited the
value that could be stored on a card to less than the amount required for international calls.
One advantage of JCL’s card-phone system was that it operated on a much lower capital
investment than ACG’s wireless system. However, JCL’s low level of investment meant that the
company did not qualify for Investment Promotion Center benefits, which included tax and duty
exemptions. ACG estimated that the foregone benefits added 75% to the cost of JCL’s pay phones. 8
Cellular Phone Service xxx By the end of 1995, two licenses had been issued for cellular services in
Tanzania. Mobitel, a joint venture between TTCL and Luxembourg-based Millicom International
Cellular S.A., began operating in Dar es Salaam in October 1994 with a network that covered Dar es
Salaam and Zanzibar. 9 The company targeted a small high-income niche market and had a base of
approximately 350 customers after offering service for nearly a year. Mobitel expected to increase the
number of subscribers to 5,000 over five years. Tritel, a Tanzanian/Malaysian venture that began
operating in late 1995, also targeted a subscriber base of 5,000.
The costs associated with cell-phone service were high. Mobitel’s initial capital investment in
its cellular grid was estimated at US$7.5 million and customer fees were approximately US$1,800 for
a phone, US$40.00 for monthly service, and US$0.40 per minute of use. The entry of Tritel into the
market was expected to result in somewhat lower fees.
Mobitel’s license required it to operate 20-30 pay phones on its cellular system. Industry
observers believed that Mobitel would only meet the minimum requirement and would select a
technology that supported a wide range of calling features. Mobitel had acquired cellular licenses in
7 Although service distributors—particularly distributors of pay phone services—were competitors of TTCL,
they also provided the agency with badly needed revenue that could be used for infrastructure upgrades.
8 The minimum qualifying investment level was $500,000.

with Tanganyika to become Tanzania.

other African countries. Within Tanzania, the company planned to expand its network to several
other cities, including Arusha and Mwanza.
African Communications Group
ACG, Inc., was organized as a corporate holding company headquartered in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. ACG Telesystems Limited, operator of the card-phone venture in Tanzania, was
located in Dar es Salaam. A separate local subsidiary, ACG Paging Systems, would be established for
paging. 10 While ACG Telesystems operated within the general framework of the parent company’s
policies and systems, it had separate human-resource policies that reflected local laws. ACG’s
shareholders included the management team, businesses, private investors, and venture capitalists.
Operations
ACG’s long-term strategy was to exploit significant economies of scale and scope through
multiple ventures in Africa. The Tanzanian pay-phone network would serve as a foundation not only
for paging and voice-mail, but also for data communications, private networks, and other
communications and media services.
Wireless Card-Operated Pay PhonesxxxACG planned to develop a network of 1,000 card phones
in the major cities of Tanzania. By the end of 1996, it would install 400 phones in Dar es Salaam. By
the end of 1998, it would extend the network by installing 200 phones in each of three other
Tanzanian cities.
Operating expenses for the pay-phone system would include costs for cards and their
packaging; commissions paid to retailers; charges from TTCL; and overhead that included salaries,
maintenance costs, and marketing costs. Capital costs for each new phone site would be about
US$5,100. This figure included the cost of the phone itself at US$1,200, the phone booth housing at
US$500, and one-fifth of an outstation at US$3,400. These costs would be lower if the market
supported more than 5 phones per outstation.
ACG would also incur additional fixed costs associated with radio transmission and its
central platform. The central tower was located on top of the University of Dar es Salaam’s tallest
building—100 meters above sea level and 6 kilometers outside the central city. The site provided
excellent coverage of both the city and its outlying area. Additional space at the site could be used to
support data network services.
Total capital costs for the first 200 pay phones, the radio transmission system, and the central
platform were forecast at US$3.5 million. Operating cash flows from the card-phone venture were
expected to be positive after the first six months of operation. Exhibit 5 describes three pay-back
scenarios. ACG conservatively forecast daily usage at one-third the rate on existing phones.
Paging/Virtual Phone Service xxx In late 1995, ACG learned that it had been awarded one of five
licenses issued by the TCC for paging services. Users would be charged US$20 to US$150 for the
pager itself, and US$20 per month for service. This monthly fee was slightly higher than the US$15-
18 monthly fee charged by TTCL for basic phone service. For an extra $5.00 per month, an ACG
paging subcriber could rent a voice mailbox. ACG anticipated a base of 10,000 subscribers in Dar es
Salaam.
10 Establishing a separate local subsidiary was a condition TCC had required for the paging license.

Marketing and Sales
In 1994, ACG analyzed options for locating its pay phones. Criteria used to identify the first
200 sites included traffic density, security, lighting, physical conditions, telephone availability, and
proximity to retail establishments where cards could be sold. Among locations that met these criteria
were the airport, train and bus facilities, hotels, shopping areas, office complexes, hospitals,
educational facilities, and clusters of dukas. Another two hundred sites were identified for the next
phase of expansion.
Once locations had been identified, ACG’s marketing group investigated property ownership
at each site. Many of the properties were owned by the National Housing Authority or by other state
corporations such as the Tanzania Harbor Authority, the Postal Commission, and the Railway
Corporation. Finding officials to approve the requests was a lengthy process. Some owners requested
annual rent payments. ACG management believed that low space requirements for phone booths
meant that rents would be low. Power connections were available at all sites and the company
planned to minimize the effects of power interruptions by installing battery-operated back-up power
at each location. The presence of nearby businesses was expected to inhibit vandalism.
ACG planned a large multi-media campaign for the pay-phone launch. Print, radio, and
television advertising would be used to build awareness. ACG’s sales force would demonstrate
phone use and assist customers at phone booths with call procedures. To help customers associate
product quality and convenience with the ACG name, a colorful logo would be displayed
prominently on each phone booth and phone card. All promotional materials were developed in the
United States by a professional marketing group and sent by air freight to Tanzania. An American
marketing director had been relocated to Tanzania to oversee the marketing and advertising
program.
Table 1 shows the rates that ACG planned to charge for calls. ACG believed that the quality,
dependability, and convenience of its product made the system attractive enough to command a
premium over TTCL. TTCL operated its phone system at a loss.

ACG’s prices reflected a markup of US$0.035 per pulse unit over the base rate that TTCL
charged ACG for local calls. 11 The company anticipated that TTCL’s rates would increase when
TTCL became private. Although a regulatory commission monitored TTCL’s price increases, the
margin that ACG Telesystems added to each call was not subject to regulatory approval. ACG
planned to maintain its absolute margin by passing TTCL price increases through to consumers.
Indeed, as the volume of calls increased, ACG hoped to increase its margin by negotiating a better
11 Pulse units were a measurement used by TTCL to determine call charges. The pulse rate varied depending on
whether a call destination was local, long-distance, or international.

rate from TTCL. If ACG was successful in this renegotiation, it planned to lower prices and target
lower-income customers.
ACG planned to print prices on its cards just before sale to retailers. When necessary, per-
minute charges could quickly be changed in the central-office computer. This system gave ACG the
flexibility to respond to Tanzania’s inflation rate, which ran between 20% and 30% a year. It also gave
ACG the ability to react to changes in competitors’ prices. ACG was protected against Tanzanian
inflation because revenues were converted into U.S. currency before bills were received from
TTCL—generally a two to three month delay from the time charges were incurred.
Servicing
There were few skilled technicians in Tanzania trained to western standards. As a result,
ACG would have to invest considerable resources in training programs. The company also had taken
steps to reduce exposure to service problems. Maddy and Laguë had selected durable equipment to
avoid damage from vandalism and weather. Although phones in the field would be connected to
outstations by copper wire, a material often stolen for jewelry-making, ACG planned to place
outstations within a half a kilometer of phones and to bury the cable connection wherever possible.
The central platform was continously managed and monitored from headquarters. If calls were
blocked or a phone became inoperable, the platform would receive an immediate report. A repair
team would be dispatched within an hour in most cases. In the event of vandalism at specific
locations, phones would be moved to alternate sites.
Technology suppliers would provide ACG Telesystems with training services and after-sales
support. Suppliers and ACG’s management team would train repair crews. Replacement parts would
be stocked so that problems could be quickly resolved. Although suppliers believed that the life of
equipment was seven or more years, ACG hoped to maintain high quality and low service costs by
replacing phones approximately five years after installation. This replacement program would also
allow the company to take advantage of technological advances.
Administration
ACG recruited an experienced expatriate team to oversee its projects. Senior management
included a Chief Technology Officer, a Managing Director, Director of Finance, Director of Marketing
and Sales, Engineering Design Manager, and Engineering Operations Manager (see Exhibit 6).
Maddy had recruited seasoned managers from telecommunications projects around the world to
senior posts. Several owned equity options in either ACG or its subsidiary. The entire team except
Maddy and Laguë were based in Tanzania. Maddy and Laguë coordinated the procurement of
investment capital, legal and accounting services, information systems, and other resources from
Cambridge.
ACG Telesystems planned to hire 80 employees by the end of 1996, including technicians,
clerical, support, and sales staff. Although the senior management team was composed of expatriates,
the remaining staff would be Tanzanian. Many prospects had already been identified, including
managers from within the local telecommunications industry, University of Dar es Salaam graduates,
and professional association members. An employee manual based on Tanzanian labor regulations
had been developed by ACG and reviewed by a team of local human resource experts, and job
descriptions had been prepared. All recruits would take part in a training program that covered
corporate procedures as well as computer and job-specific skills.
Financing
ACG Telesystems had attracted US$3.5 million in debt and equity to fund working capital
and equipment purchases. No single shareholder held a majority stake in ACG. The company
expected to be profitable by its second year of operations (see Exhibit 7). Although cash flow from
initial card-phone operations would be positive after six months, the proceeds would be used to
finance the acquisition of additional equipment for expansion of the pay-phone network within
11

Tanzania. Thus, the financial success of the first 200 phone installations would determine timing of
the next phase of the roll-out. ACG’s investment and employment plans qualified the pay-phone
venture for eight years of tax exemptions. 12 Following this “tax holiday,” Tanzania’s tax rate of 35%
on profits, 10% on dividends, and 35-75% on equipment purchases would apply. All of ACG
Telesystems’ profits were fully convertible to American dollars.
Options for ACG
The speed with which telecommunications markets were opening throughout Africa meant
that ACG’s management needed to determine the best combination of opportunities in Tanzania and
elsewhere on the continent. Extending the pay-phone network beyond the four largest cities in
Tanzania was an option. Population densities were much lower than in the country’s larger urban
areas, however. Expanding the network would require over US$ 1 million in equipment and
infrastructure in each new regional area. ACG expected to fund expansion with internally generated
cash flows from the card-phone venture. Another option was to concentrate on services, such as data
communications, that could be added to the pay-phone network in Dar es Salaam.
ACG management also considered expanding to a large city in a new country. Uganda and
Zimbabwe were particularly promising. Uganda shared a border with Tanzania. Although the
country had experienced more than 20 years of political instability following independence in 1962,
its government had stabilized in the late 1980s. Like Tanzania, the Ugandan economy was dominated
by agriculture, with about 50% of its GDP produced in that sector. (Exhibit 8 compares statistics for
Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.) At the end of 1995, Uganda had a population of over 19 million,
only 11% of which lived in urban areas. About 774,000 people lived in Kampala, the country’s largest
city. The next largest city, Jinja, had a population of 65,000. Uganda’s telecommunications
infrastructure was similar to TTCL’s in Tanzania.
Zimbabwe had been politically stable since 1980, when its black majority had gained power.
The country operated under a democratic system of government. Economic activity included a
manufacturing sector that contributed 25% to GDP. The country also held a variety of mineral
resources. Agriculture generated less than 15% of GDP. In 1992, the population of Zimbabwe was
10.7 million, over 27% of which lived in urban areas. Harare, the largest city, had a population of
nearly 1.2 million, while Bulawayo, the next largest city, had a population of more than 600,000.
Zimbabwe’s telecommunications infrastructure had been improved in recent years with a fiber-optic
digital network. In 1994, the country’s telecommunications agency had been denationalized and a
private consortium was developing a cellular phone network. A regional communications network,
using a high-capacity microwave link was also under construction.
12 The Investment Promotion Center granted ACG Telesystems a five year tax exemption on profits and three
years of duty and tax exemptions during network implementation.
