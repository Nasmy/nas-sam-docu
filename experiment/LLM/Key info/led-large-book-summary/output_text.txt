</s><s><s><s>In this chapter, the focus shifts from business strategy to a review of ACG's business plans in Tanzania. After more than three years of planning, ACG is about to install a pay-phone system in the largest city, Dar es Salaam. This document is authorized for use only in Associate Professor Brandon Lee's EMBA Class of 2024 M4 Business Strategy at Melbourne Business School from Aug 2023 to Jan 2024. Tanzanian Telecom Company Limited (Tanzania) sells phone service in the rural areas and also offers paging and voice mail services to the business community in the commercial center of the country. It competes with private operators as well as public ones. The company operates several different types of pay phones: those that provide telephone service on landlines, those that offer wireless calling, and those that accept payment by credit card. In addition, there are those that allow people to send money via wired or wireless payments. As the country becomes more developed, it needs to invest in infrastructure to improve its telecommunications network. There are few skilled technicians in the country, which means that ACG has to train many of them. They also need to introduce new ways of doing business such as advertising and making sure that clients have enough money to pay for the service. For these reasons, they compete with other companies offering similar services in order to keep up with the market.</s>
